The purpose of this project is gender detection by people who use formal english. For this, I am training a model using the [samzirbo/europarl.en-es.gendered](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samzirbo/europarl.en-es.gendered) dataset. The dataset is a completely structured dataset. I also use microsoft's deberta-v3-large transformers model for training.

In addition to the model I will train; this model can be expanded for informal and unstructred language used in social media by creating an unstructred dataset with web scrapping and fine-tuning this model. But since the dataset contains more than 700,000 rows even after removing the neutral label, i think we will need an unstructured informal english dataset with at least that many rows. Once we have done this, we can create a model that can recognize common word patterns and relationships between different genders that a human being may not consciously recognize.
